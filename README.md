## README file

Hello! Thanks for using our restuarant recommender program! Let's get started.

## Getting started

You will first need a Yelp and OpenAI account.

* For Yelp:

1. Create a Yelp (for developers) account if you have not yet using this link https://www.yelp.com/developers
2. Using this link https://www.yelp.com/developers/v3/manage_app, you should be able to create your own app and receive an API key
3. Use that API key in order to run the Yelp portion of the program

* For OpenAI

1. Create a OpenAI account if you have not already
2. Using this link https://platform.openai.com/api-keys, you should be able to see your available API keys
3. Create a new project API key and copy the key into a safe document (only for you to see)
4. Use that API key in order to run the Yelp portion of the program

Once your Yelp and OpenAI API keys have been created, you can now run the program smoothly.
